# ElmeasMaths

This is my own maths library, I regularly add some feature.

I renamed it to "RedFoxMaths" because we'll use it in a custom engine named RedFoxEngine.

If you want to use it, you should define FOXMATHS_IMPLEMENTATION in your .cpp files, because is an headeronly library.

I'll maybe do a C# version later on the same repository.
